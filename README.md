# Glint Case Study: Backend

## Getting started
1. Create and activate venv
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. `fastapi run`

## Notes
This is a simple FastAPI project with one unprotected GET endpoint at `/waves/max_height`.

**For a real application, I would usually implement:**
- Authentication + Authorization
- Logging
- Unit + Integration Tests
